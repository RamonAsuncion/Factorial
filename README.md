## 1. Give a point (洧논,洧녽), let 洧녾=洧논+洧녰洧녽

and create a function that computes

洧녭1(洧녾)=洧녾2+洧녫

for some 洧녫=洧녫1+洧녰洧녫2
.

## 2. Given a starting point (洧논,洧녽), create a function escape_time that recursivly computes

z_i = f(f(f(...f(z)...)

stopping when |洧녾洧녰|>2
. The function should return the number 洧녰 of times the function has to be applied before |洧녾洧녰|>2

.

## 3. Compute escape_time for every number on a grid for x in [-2,2] and y in [-2,2] with a step of .01. Construct an array with the results, and plot the array using plt.imshow. Run this for

洧녫=1

洧녫=1+洧녰
洧녫=.7885

Extra

## 1. Instead of 洧녭2(洧녾)=洧녾2+洧녫, use a different function line 洧논3+洧녫. What do you get?

## 2. Rewrite escape_time so that it switches between 洧녭1 and 洧녭2 randomly at each step.
